# What is to be done?

The argument in favour of Palestinian rights has been won in all but the most Zionist segments of American and American allied societies. The skyrocketing negative opinions of the State of Israel, and the fact that American politicians are starting to get called out in their town halls is proof of that. But as that happens...

...the American empire, instead of retreating, seems to be throwing more and more resources into maintaining the Zionist Apartheid state by expanding the destruction of surrounding regions especially right now in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. And worst of all, approving, funding, and arming the full on invasion and blatant ethnic cleansing plan of the Israeli state in Gaza here in August 2025

But what doesn't change is what we're supposed to do to fight for justice from within the empire. It really feels like our leaders wish to finish the ethnic cleansing and takeover of Gaza in front of the glazed over eyes of a broken and apathetic world citizenry that will accept any atrocity as long as it’s not happening to them personally.

So let’s prove that wrong and keep following the final wishes of Refaat Alareer, the Palestinian poet who wanted his death to be a tale that brought hope and was murdered by Israel on the 6th of December 2023, the Palestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, murdered by Israel on the 16th of April 2025 who wanted a “loud death… I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time..”, and Anas Al-Sharif, who spoke to us posthumously and said.

"I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland".

Pressure has brought us this far, increasing the pressure is the only way to see justice done, and justice restored for all of the people of Palestine.

We keep pushing. We keep pushing harder.
