# Time is running away

So here we are less than four months away from the launch of my book and I'm five days late in making my monthly post.

It's kind of reflective of where I find myself. It's been a very busy month for me personally but my book marketing has suffered as a result.

So instead of giving an overview of how my month went as I usually do I want to talk about why I think I haven't been focusing on getting the word out about "Under the Full and Crescent Moon".

<!-- more -->

## The other stuff

The first is of course that I've been busy and distracted with life. Work, Family, all of it is busy as, Alhamdulillah it should be. There have been challenges, but nothing that we haven't been able to overcome and I was able to spend some time doing fun things with my family, which was sorely overdue.

The second is there has been a lot of more urgent matters that I've felt the need to comment on, the Canadian Federal election which ended up being a mixed bag for Palestinian matters (and I have a lot of thoughts on how to improve Canadian democracy [on this page](clmp_proportional.md)), the horror of the genocidal campaign against Palestine which includes not only repeated horrific attacks but an undeniable use of starvation as a weapon of war.

## Turning attention to the book

Finally, when I always imagined myself speaking about the book, I always wanted to start by speaking to the most novel part of it, which is the setting being not only a Muslim matriarchy, but a matriarchy that I describe as being fully compliant with Islamic law.

And before I can do *that* I feel like I should put into words how I feel we, as a Muslim community, should, in general, deal with differences of opinion on what Islam is.

I did that, in a blog post [on this page](InnerFaithDialogue.md) and it took longer to write than I expected. The core takeaway for me is that differences are inevitable and we need to be talk about them with mutual respect. I'm hoping it's in that spirit that the novel is received.

## What's next?

The plan is to make this blog post and the previous one into videos and then the stage will be set to start talking more about the book.

But one thing is certain. I'm not going to stop talking about Palestine until Palestine is not only free, but rebuilt.
