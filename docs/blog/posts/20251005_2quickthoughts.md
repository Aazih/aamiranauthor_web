# A simple history

The history of West Asia after WWI is not complicated. It's a very straightforward story...

... of the malign and horrific influence of Western Europeans and then the United States which was designed to, and succeeded in, dividing the people and using the resulting chaos and death and destruction to dominate the region to exploit it's resources and trade routes.

The only 'complications' comes from bending into mental pretzels to try to obscure or deny this obvious fact.

## Lesser of two evils

An example of this 'complexity' which is not complex at all is Israel.

Frankly the only reason that Israel has ever been seen as 'good' or even the 'lesser of two evils' as compared to any Palestinian resistance organization that has ever existed, is purely vibes based. And those vibes are Islamophobia and anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bigotry. That's it.
