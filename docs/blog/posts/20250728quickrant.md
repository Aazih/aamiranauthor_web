# 5th stage Malnutrition

I never knew what 5th stage malnutrition was, in a reality where the world produces more than enough food for everyone on the planet[^1], I should never have to. But...

<!-- more -->

But I do, because of the depth of evil of the Zionist, apartheid, genocidal state of Israel as the people of Gaza enter this terminal stage as was completely predicted when the State of Israel  blocked aid on the 2nd of March 2025.[^2]

Now I'm not surprised by Israel, I've known the horror of the state of Israel for decades now.

What I *am* surprised by is how durable and inexhaustible the evil of the United States of America is. Millions of Palestinians in Gaza are literally starving to death and the world is unable to act, entirely because of the America and the American bloc of countries which includes allies like Canada and governments propped up by the US like those of Egypt and Jordan.

I think they want us to get disheartened, despondent, give up, move on, and finally allow the state of Israel to complete the genocide and grab more land just as that state has been doing since it's horrific and bloody inception in 1948.

But that's not going to happen. The vast majority of Palestinians and their growing numbers of allies are always going to be speaking. We are going to get louder. We are going to act harder. We have seen the tyranny, and we all understand now the nature of evil. And the human spirit cries out to fight against it. And what the state of Israel and the United States of America have done, will be remembered for as long as humans are able to authentically record history.

## Aid Farce

The amount of aid Israel is now allowing into the Gaza Strip through dangerous air drops and not nearly enough trucks is completely inadequate[^3], what Gaza needs is nothing less than full unfettered access to aid that is not restricted in any way so that medical professionals can bring people back carefully from the brink of starvation in a medically managed fashion with all the resources they need. So this is a purely performative gesture.

So why are they doing this at all? The answer is actually the same as the answer to a bad faith BS Zionist argument that if Israel wanted they could have ended the lives of everyone in Gaza much faster and therefore 'there's no genocide'.

And that is imagine a genocide that allows complicit and compromised politicians like Mark Carney, Kier Starmer, and Ursula von der Leyen etc., the ability to say with a straight face that their non-existent pressure is 'working'. Imagine a genocide which gives just enough plausibility to American media and the media of America's complicit allies that 'matters are improving' and so no more escalation is needed such as sanctions and military intervention.

You don't need to imagine it. It's what's exactly been happening in Gaza for close to two years now. Well you can't hide people starving to death in masses, and the propaganda is not working anymore. The genocidal state of Israel has lost all moral legitimacy forever. These crimes cannot be forgotten, and the human soul cries out for more action to stop them. We need escalation.

## Conditional Human Rights

Conditioning the human rights of Palestinians is disgusting. But that's exactly what Mark Carney has done by conditioning Canada's recognition of the state of Palestine on, among other things, the resulting state being demilitarized[^4]. Three questions here.

* First what conditions is Mark Carney putting on continuing to recognize Israel? Why are there only conditions on one side of this conflict?
* Secondly and more importantly why is Mark Carney denying the right of Palestinians to defend themselves from a hostile neighbour that has displaced and murdered millions of their people for decades, namely the genocidal Zionist state of Israel?
* Finally, shouldn't the country carrying out the starvation and genocide, Israel, be the ones that Carney is calling on to disarm?

This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to get back to the status quo of September 2023, which was one of injustice and oppression. The difference is that now Israel is unmasked for the genocidal state that it has always been. It's not going to work Carney. There's no going back.

You can wish for a reality where there is oppression but no resistance. Where there is no call for justice for crimes committed by an evil ally of the American bloc. But wishing won't make it come true. Free Palestine from the river to the sea.
