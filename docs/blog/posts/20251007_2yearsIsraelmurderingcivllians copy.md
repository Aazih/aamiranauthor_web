# Civilians murdered on Oct 7

Let us talk about the civilians murdered on the 7th of October 2023. Civilians such as Awni El-Dous.

## Awni El-Dous

Awni was a 12 or 13 year old boy who inherited his love of technology from his father who was a computer engineer. He wanted his YouTube gaming channel to gain millions of followers. He is described as having been a happy and confident child with an ever-lasting smile.

And on the 7th of October 2023 he was murdered when the top of the three story residential building he lived in was struck by Israeli bombs, along with his parents, his two older sisters and two younger brothers.[^1] All of these were human beings, containing entire universes of hopes and dreams and fears and love. That they were snuffed out along with so many others in Gaza is solely the fault of the genocidal Zionist state of Israel and its Western backers.

But what about the Israeli civilians? For that let's turn to an investigation by Ynet news in Israel from the 12th of January 2024. The investigation reveals that on the 7th of October the IDF actually instructed all of its combat units to stop "at all costs" any attempt for Palestinians to return to Gaza from Israel, even if it meant risking or harming the lives of civilians in the area, including any hostages themselves.[^2]

So yes, let's talk about the civilians murdered on the 7th of October 2023, by Israel in both Gaza and Israel. Because it is the murder of civilians by *that entity* that is at the root of the matter. And this has been happening since way before Oct 7th, in fact the civilians whose murder it took to even ***create*** the state in 1947 and 1948 are at the heart of all this.

Free Palestine, from the River to the Sea, and let us bring justice for all of the civilians harmed in the region since the oppression started, the vast majority of whom are at the hands of the Zionists.

All sources on my blog, all opinions my own, in the end only God knows best. May he grant us the strength to pursue justice and liberation until we achieve it.
