# A quick note on Kirk and the only way back to a sane normal

Charlie Kirk was an unarmed non-combatant and he was lethally targeted on the 10th of September 2025 on a university campus in Utah. His life ending with a long distance bullet to the neck in the USA.[^1]

I am going to be completely morally consistent here.

<!-- more -->

Any injury to a non-combatant or civilian is unjustifiable. Kirk's murderer needs to be caught and brought to justice just like anyone else who causes harm to any non-combatant or civilian.

The fact that he was a media personality making controversial statements makes no difference. Because to say it does is to accept a world in which it's open season on controversial media personalities. A Zionist Israeli world in which a murderous genocidal state can just proclaim journalists to be controversial and thus justify ending not only their lives but everyone they are close to. I refuse to accept such a world.

And make no mistake it is Israeli Zionism and the Israeli state that has normalized this horror. You cannot systematically murder, with impunity, far more than 200 journalists and other media figures and not cheapen their lives. Abu-Akleh, Al-Areer, Hassouna, Al-Sharif, are just four examples of these ***hundreds***.

The only way to end this and move ahead to a saner normal is to end the impunity that the Israeli state and Israeli Zionism have enjoyed and not only dismantle them but to ensure they take their place in the annals of history in the same league as the most vile philosophies and villainous states that humanity has ever known. That is the only consequence that will overturn what they have decided will be normal. There is no sane future in which the media murdering, politically violent, Zionist state of Israel still exists.

All opinions my own. In the end only God knows best.
