# Sign a Petition. Direct support of Palestinians

So there's a Canadian petition collecting signatures called e-6662 and it's the first link on my bio. It calls for the Canadian government to cut ties with Israel in concrete ways. The fact this is sponsored by a Liberal Member of Parliament is a big deal and I'll get into why.[^1]

So first off please sign it and while you're there, if you could consider supporting two Palestinians that I am supporting as well. One is Omar who is a Palestinian in Vancouver doing what he can to support his family in Gaza and the second is Jamal who is a Palestinian in Gaza. Please do what you can here, it will make you feel less helpless, I promise you.

Now the reason this is a big deal is that Canada has a culture of extreme deference to one's own party leader.[^2] This is why Canada has been completely complicit in the genocide of Palestinians since it kicked into high gear in October 2023. Justin Trudeau the Prime Minister at the time is a self proclaimed Zionist for some reason, and Mark Carney, the Prime Minister now in September 2025, nearly two years later is so delusional in his admiration of the ethno-supremacist ideology that he, with a straight face, called for a Zionist Palestine, demilitarized as to be completely incapable of protecting itself from it's genocidal and Zionist neighbour. Their Liberal Party has marched in lock step with this insanity and continued to send arms and tax dollars and savings to the Zionist state while lying about it to defuse the anger from a Canadian public increasingly critical of Israel.[^3]

That a MP from Mark Carney's own party would sponsor a petition that calls for an actual end to all forms of military support, cancelling the Canada Israel Free Trade Agreement and imposing Russia like sanctions, and launching investigations of Canadian collaborators with Israel is significant.

Is it enough? Absolutely not. But it is light years ahead of where Canada has been, and that is testament to the pressure that Canadians have been putting on the Liberal Party.

So sign the petition but don't stop there. Keep calling your representatives, and keep protesting. It is working. For example the absolute disgrace that Canada allowed the Israeli tennis team to sports-wash Israel's genocide of Palestinians and play in Canada was alleviated by Canadian outrage forcing the team to play in an empty stadium. Where our government is failing to turn Israel into a pariah, Canadian citizens are stepping up. Let's keep going.
