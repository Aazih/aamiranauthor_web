# Three quick thoughts

ContraPoints is a very successful creator of YouTube video essays that are critical of American politics and discourse from a progressive perspective. She has been silent on the genocide of the Palestinian people until about two weeks ago and while there are plenty of other commentators that have raked her comments over the coals. I want to pen my own thoughts down.

Also a Zio defended the concepts of ethno-states and I need to clarify my own thoughts there as well.

Finally AOC disappoints yet again.

## Contrapoints

There are three main problems with her statement.

### Mostly not about Palestinians

Of the 845 or so words of the statement most of them were not about Palestinians at all. They were about 54 or so talking about the genocide of Palestinians, and even in those words I'm including what Contrapoints says she feels about it. That's like less than 7%. Most of it is spent talking about:

* Contrapoints herself
* Leftists
* The feelings of Israelis
* Untruths about the power America had to end the genocide.
* Defending Zionism
* Conflating AntiZionism with AntiSemitism in a 'nuanced way'
* Blaming Leftists for slightly contributing to Trump being elected and making her less safe as a Trans person.

Not only is this barely about Palestinians what is completely missing is even one word about ***What Palestinians themselves want us to do*** which is to be loud in amplifying their voices and letting the world know what is happening to them.

### Advocates for Silence

Because Palestinians by and large say that the *silence* Contrapoints is defending is exactly what has allowed the oppression of Palestinians to continue for decades and for their genocide to grind on for almost two years in Gaza here in July 2025 as well as the accelerated ethnic cleansing in the West Bank. They want us to be loud. But this doesn't seem to matter to ContraPoints like... at all.

### No solution other than let it happen

In the end ContraPoints offers nothing more than being silent about an ongoing genocide. Yeah well silence is complicity and the people who have dragged her for her complicity publicly are ensuring that her compliance with a horror of horrors is not normalized. Being silent about millions of people being ***starved to death*** is certainly a choice. But it is a choice that cannot be justified.

## Ethno-states

A very odd genre of Zionist apologia is defending the concept of ethno-states and I really had to clarify for myself why this is kind of insane.

First we have to get past the conflation of ethno-state, with a state that has an ethno-majority. Just because a state has an ethnic majority does *not* make it an ethno-state. An ethno-state is "a country populated by, or dominated by the interests of, a single racial or ethnic group".

To put it simply, an ethno-state, by definition is driven by ethno-supremacist ideologies and enacts ethno-supremacist policies. And Ethno-supremacy is evil, no matter who does it, whether it be Japanese people, German People, Turkish people, white people, or Jewish people. No exceptions.

## AOC votes for hundreds of millions of dollars for genocide

So called progressive Alexandria Ocasio Cortez voted to send hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid to the genocidal state of Israel. Her defense of this heinous act is that the money is for defensive purposes. This absolute nonsense completely ignores that this frees up hundreds of millions of dollars for Israel to funnel towards continuing the genocide that is now literally starving Palestinians to death. There is no reason to send even one dollar to a state committing *genocide* for *any reason* let alone 500 million of them.
