## Pathfinder Second Edition

I started playing ttrpgs with Pathfinder First Edition in 2014, about five years later the second edition of the game was released and, I really really love both playing and GMing it.

Enough that I have created YouTube videos providing commentary on the rules, creatures for the game, and a massive supplement for character creation that I hope will be released soon.

### Why'd you do that pf2e?

### Monsters
I entered the Rpg Superstar 2023 monster creation competition and while I didn't do too well. I'm still proud of the two critters I created.

* [Slurry Shambler](https://rpgsuperstar.com/creatures/3200) An ice and mud themed elemental that I feel would be fun to throw at your players in a spring thaw sort of season.
* [Gravelight](https://rpgsuperstar.com/creatures/3561) A high concept low level ally creature for most undead hunting campaigns or a foe for an undead party.
