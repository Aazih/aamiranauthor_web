# The Horror of Israeli logic spreads even further

On the 21st of May 2025, two staff members of the Israeli embassy in Washington were gunned down in what seems to be a premediated attack in Washington D.C, the capital of the United States of America. The two were not armed, they were not combatants.

It should go without saying that causing any injury to non-combatants is horrific and an act worthy of condemnation.

There are three takeaways here though, that if not realized and acted upon will keep the situation of the world degrading further and further.

## Nothing on the ground in Palestine changes

The complete blockade of food, water, and medical supplies that has caused untold misery, injury, and death in Palestine and the incessant bombing that takes seemingly hundreds of lives every single day, hasn't changed one bit. The urgency of the matter has not decreased even a little and in a sane world would remain one of the top priorities of the world to resolve. The attack in Washington does not change this. The Western mass media, I am sure, will not agree.

## Israeli rhetoric of acceptable targets

The constant refrain from the state of Israel vilifying the governing authority of Gaza in its entirety has the effect of justifying the death of any member of it, no matter how far removed from combat they may be. A nurse, a sanitation worker, a doctor, all become tainted by the dehumanizing rhetoric that spews out of Israeli mouthpieces.

We got an answer of what it looks like when the that logic is applied to the governing authority of Israel.

The logical response would be to drop that line of reasoning completely and without exception. There should be no double standard or exceptionalism when it comes to non-combatants. It falls on the world to force all sides in the region to adhere to this. Sanctions might be enough to do this, but it has to happen as soon as possible.

## The abject failure of Zionism

The only purpose of Zionism that makes sense is to provide safety for the Jewish people. It has completely failed at this objective both inside and outside the Levant, Zionism makes Jewish people unsafe. In Israel by requiring constant injustice against occupied people. And outside by conflating that with every Jewish person.

The only rational response is to drop the failed ideology and work towards a world where **all** people are safe **everywhere**.

Free Palestine. Safety for all.
