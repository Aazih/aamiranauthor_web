# There is no excuse

* Book Came in
* I wrote acknowledgements
* I keep on getting ideas for videos
Unboxing with my family.
Never thought of myself as a novelist, or a fiction writer, I just had an idea that screamed out to be a novel, and years of effort later, here it is.
I'm going to make another video to thank all the people that need to be thanked to make this a reality but for now. I'm just going to enjoy it.
I mean it looks great, it sounds great, it smells amazing. And don't worry I'm not going to taste it, but if you want one of these for yourselves or buy a great gift for everyone you've ever met because you're so generous. I just want to let you know how you can preorder it.

Preorder
Go onto Goodreads search for "under the full and crescent moon" and click the want to read button. I've heard it helps.
