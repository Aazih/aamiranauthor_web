# There is no excuse

You cannot suddenly and accidentally starve a people to death. It is a slow, premeditated and obvious evil.
<!-- more -->

Especially in an age of social media where we have all seen it happen over months and years, if we cared to. It is obvious to anyone who has listened to international and independent aid agencies and human rights organizations. Most importantly it has been obvious to anyone who listens to Palestinians who are reporting everything that is happening to them in real-time in Gaza. Reporting what is being done to them by the State of Israel and the United States of America.

## The Western Cover

Those, who instead, trusted the politicians and the mass media, only realized this when the atrocities being carried out by Israel and America for nearly two years became undeniable. Their trust was betrayed in the worst way.

While it is the American presidents, both Biden and Trump, who are directly responsible for this horror of horrors. I as a Canadian will focus on the complicity and the cover provided by the Canadian politicians who have deflected blame from, and ran cover for, the genocidal state of Israel as it slowly destroyed all civilian infrastructure and sidelined the aid organizations, such as UNWRA, which were keeping Palestinians in Gaza from death by starvation. These are former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, former Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, current Prime Minister Mark Carney, and Foreign Minister Anita Anand. Not only that, they armed the genocide, and took the lead in aiding the starvation by attacking the reputation of UNWRA for no good reason. They are guilty of aiding and abetting genocide.

While it is the American media that has most effectively justified, denied, and minimized the abomination funded and armed by the United States of America and carried out by Israel. I as a Canadian will focus on the both-siderism, Islamophobia, Anti-Arab bigotry, and false accusations of anti-Semitism deployed by the Canadian media to provide cover for the Zionist genocide that will stain America and American allies forever. These are, on TV, CBC, CTV, and Global, and in Print, the National Post, the Globe and Mail, and the Toronto Star. All of these places bear large responsibility for what is happening in Gaza and we must call it out and we must never forget what they did and are doing.

## The Dehumanization

Just you cannot accidentally and suddenly starve a people to death. You cannot accidentally and suddenly become a people who are willing to do so. It happens over years and generations of indoctrination and dehumanization and just like starvation it cannot be done in secret and has to be done out in the open. Unlike starvation though, this fact about Zionist Israeli society was successfully ignored by the politicians and the media of America and American allies like Canada, the UK, and Germany.

The death of Ali Dawabsheh, an 18 month old toddler who died in an Israeli settler arson attack, was celebrated and mocked in the worst ways by Israelis, for example chanting things like "Where is Ali? Ali's on the grill". This was in 2015 and there was no consequence.

An Israeli general likened Palestinians to cockroaches, in 1983. There were no consequences.

Around 400 Palestinian villages and towns were destroyed by Zionists in 1948.

Zionists have been violating Palestinian rights in Palestine since 1883.

What is happening now in 2025 to Palestinians in Palestine at the hands of Zionists is no surprise. There is nothing sudden or accidental about it. The inertia of Europeans and Americans leaders ignoring the evil of the ethno-supremacist ideology of Zionism however has run out. There's no going back.

## Conclusion

Justice demands nothing less than a Free Palestine from the river to the sea.
