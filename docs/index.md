<p style="text-align: center;">Usually on an author's website there would be a big fancy splash page of the cover of the author's latest book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The reason there isn't one here is that I haven't published a book yet!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But in Fall 2025, my debut novel "Under the Full and Crescent Moon" is slated to come out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'm on a journey, and I hope you'll come along.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because while I'm excited to be on this road. It's always better with company.</p>
