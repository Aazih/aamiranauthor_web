# Progressive Islam

I consider myself to be a Progressive Muslim and that has gotten easier to explain over the years as I can just point to one of the many examples of Muslim identifying politicians in the West that are more than happy to march and mug for the cameras in Pride Parades.

These are all invariably left of center politicians. And of course there's a lot of diversity of opinion between them just like any set of individuals, but for me the approach can be summed up as a faith that focuses on the social justice and economic justice sides of Islam, such as the belief that "there is no compulsion in religion" and the dire warnings again hoarding wealth. Rather than focusing on the socially conservative sides of the faith such as the emphasis on modesty and the very strongly defined gender roles.

Now does that make me "less" of a Muslim, a "bad" Muslim, or not a Muslim at all? I don't believe so, but more importantly, that is a judgment that only God can make right?

Which doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to debate and discuss these things of course. For example any person who calls themselves either progressive or Muslim and aren't speaking up about and fighting for the freedom of Palestinians in all of Palestine, I don't think are living up to the standards of either and I'm not hesitant to say it. But I do it while remembering that all opinions are my own... and in the end only God knows best.

My novel coming out soon, "Under the Full and Crescent Moon" actually deals head on with a lot of points of difference between progressive and conservative Muslims such as hijab, interfaith marriage, and more as it is set in an imagined Muslim Matriarchal society. I hope it's a respectful addition to the debate. It's gotten some very kind early reviews and I really appreciate the reviewers who enjoyed the characters as I worked really hard on them. I hope you'll check it out, but more than that, act for Palestine every day until Palestine is free!
