# Blatant Israeli evil

I saw a video of a Palestinian man released from Israeli torture who found out that his family had been murdered by Israel. He was besides himself with grief; the small little gift he had made for his daughter now useless.[^1]

I saw another video of a different Palestinian man whose Israeli torturers had told him they had murdered his family and was shocked to find them alive and waiting for him. I cannot comprehend the mental agony they put him through.[^2]

Any one of these examples is more than enough to prove that the state of Israel does not deserve any allies, even one dollar in aid, and not even a single solitary supplied bullet. If you are not seeing these heart rending scenes in your preferred sources of information then I would urge you to deeply consider the distorted view of the world they are feeding you.

But if these are not enough to prove how completely bereft of morality the state of Israel has become, and you are not moved by the fact they are still threaten to withhold desperately needed aid[^3], or that they are still killing Palestinians in Gaza despite there being a 'ceasefire'[^4]. Consider the murder of yet another Palestinian journalist, Saleh al-Jafarawi.[^5]

## Saleh al-Jafarawi

He was not murdered by Israel directly, but by a militia supported by Israel. I cannot think of a better example of Israel using divide and conquer tactics on the Palestinian people to continue their oppression. It's an evil colonial tactic that has caused untold harm in every part of the world unfortunate enough to have suffered from European and American colonialism. Here is his will. His final words to us.

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds, Who said: “And do not think of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision.”

I am Saleh. I leave this will, not as a farewell, but as a continuation of a path I have chosen with certainty.

Allah knows that I have exerted every effort and strength I possess to be a support and a voice for my people. I have lived through pain and oppression in all its details, tasted the agony and the loss of loved ones time and again, and yet I never hesitated for a single day to convey the truth as it is—the truth that will remain a testament against all who faltered and remained silent, and also an honor for all who supported, stood by, and championed the most noble, honorable, and dignified people: the people of Gaza.

If I am martyred, know that I have not departed… I am now in Paradise, with my companions who preceded me; with Anas, Ismail, and all the loved ones who remained true to their covenant with Allah.

I urge you to remember me in your prayers, and to continue the journey after me. Remember me with ongoing charity, and mention me whenever you hear the call to prayer or see the light piercing through the night of Gaza.

I urge you to uphold the resistance… The path we have walked, and the approach we have believed in. We have known no other path for ourselves, nor found meaning in life except in steadfastness upon it.

I urge you to care for my father… my beloved, my role model, in whom I saw myself and who saw himself in me. You who stood by me through the trials of war with all it entailed… I ask Allah that we meet in the gardens of Paradise, and that you are pleased with me, O crown of my head.

I urge you to care for my brother, my teacher, and my companion on this journey, Naji. O Naji… I have preceded you to Allah before you were released from prison. Know that this is a fate written by Allah, and that my longing for you resides within me. I wished to see you, to embrace you, to meet you, but Allah’s promise is true, and our meeting in Paradise is closer than you think.

I urge you to care for my mother… O mother, life without you is nothing. You were the ceaseless prayer, the wish that never dies. I prayed to Allah to heal you and grant you well-being, and how I dreamed of seeing you travel for treatment and return smiling.

I urge you to care for my brothers and sisters. My aim is to please Allah and then to please you. I ask Allah to make you happy and to make your lives as pure as your tender hearts, which I always tried to be a source of joy for.

I always said: Let not the word fall, nor the image fade. The word is a trust, and the image is a message. Carry them to the world as we have carried them.

Do not think that my martyrdom is the end, but rather the beginning of a long journey toward freedom. I am a messenger of a message I wanted to reach the world—to the world that closes its eyes, and to those who remain silent about the truth. And if you hear of my passing, do not weep for me. I have long wished for this moment and asked Allah to grant it to me. All praise is due to Allah, Who chose me for what I love.

To all those who wronged me in my life with insults or false slander, I say to you: Here I am, departing to Allah as a martyr, by His permission, and with Allah, all disputes will be settled.

I urge you to care for Palestine… for Al-Aqsa Mosque… It was my wish to reach its courtyard, to pray in it, to touch its soil. If I do not reach it in this world, I ask Allah to gather us all there in the gardens of eternity."
