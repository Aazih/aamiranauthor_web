# The Justice Free narrative of Mark Carney

I have always loved stories, and believe deeply in the power of narratives.

Which is why one of the most disheartening and repulsive things to me is the attempt to establish a dishonest and unjust narrative.

<!-- more -->

Which is exactly what Mark Carney's statement on the 30th of July 2025 on the recognition of a Palestinian State is. While on the surface this is a shift in the Canadian position towards being more pro Palestine, in substance it is anything but.

Right from the start the problems are apparent. The first thing Carney states is that Canada is committed to

* Two state solution
* Peace and security

By prioritizing these things over justice Carney's Canada is perfectly fine with the end result being a negative peace which is nothing more than an absence of conflict and with no real justice for Palestinians.

Then Carney attempts to distort reality. He describes the obstacles to his vision of the future, as being on one hand, the heinous violent attacks of some Palestinians against Israel, while on the other the 'ongoing failure by the Israeli government to prevent the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian disaster in Gaza, with impeded access to to food and other essential humanitarian supplies.'

The ugly gaslighting is the last sentence is disgusting and repulsive. It makes it seem like Israel is trying to prevent a humanitarian disaster and just not succeeding when in fact they are the complete and total cause of it. To describe people starving to death as 'impeded access to food' is reprehensible. This narrative of some Palestinians being unreasonably violent while Israelis are just incompetent at improving a bad humanitarian situation is completely false and I hate that we have to fight to debunk this rather than fight to fix the root of the problem.

And it is this distorted view of reality that leads to the other atrocious fact of this statement. The fact that only the people who are currently undergoing a genocide, Palestinians, are given demands, and for what... merely the purely symbolic gift of Canada deigning to recognize their statehood.

The demands are:

* The Palestinian Authority, an organization with no real legitimate authority, reform.
* Palestinians hold general elections in 2026, which cannot be done in a free and fair manner given Israeli oppression.
* Dictating which Palestinian groups can and can not be a part of the elections.
* Stating any resulting state be demilitarized, so it cannot protect itself from an Israeli population and state that has demonstrated over nearly two years their desire to wipe Palestinians off the map.

The story Carney tells, the narrative he sets is one in which Palestinians are the obstacles to 'peace and security', Palestinians are to blame for the horror, and so Palestinians are the ones to be ordered around and controlled while Israelis are precious and to be protected. It is a perverse inversion of reality that cares nothing for justice.

As of right now, the government of Canada is on the side of the oppressors, and there is no surprise they keep on trying to arm the genocide from the shadows.
