# Two quick thoughts I'm making videos on

## First. The problem isn't that Israel is Jewish

The problem is that it's European.

People who say that it's the Jewish side of Israel that is causing it to be a murderous ethno-supremacist genocidal apartheid state are being anti-Semitic. All of that comes from the ***European*** part of Israel's nature.

## Second. A big tent... of Evil

So around early May 2025, Channel 13 news in Israel has reported that, despite what they said, the Biden administration did not work tirelessly for a ceasefire and, in fact, gave Israel total impunity to carry out "killing and destroying in the name of killing and destroying".

Which means that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez or AOC, when she said that Kamala Harris was "working tirelessly for a ceasefire" in August 2024, was spreading a lie. Especially because at the same time Harris said there was "no daylight" between her and Biden in terms of the policies of the Biden administration.

The interesting question here is why AOC does not just say that the Biden administration lied to her like they lied to everyone else and she just naively believed them.

The answer I come to gets to the rot at the top of the American Democratic Party. See, the Democratic party is a big tent party, and the problem with them isn't just that they have an evil section, but that the evil section runs the whole thing and AOC is shielding them.

I really don't care what AOC's intentions are. I care about understanding who is enabling the genocide of the Palestinian people. The leadership of the Democratic party are some of these enablers, and by protecting them, as of May 2025, so is AOC.
