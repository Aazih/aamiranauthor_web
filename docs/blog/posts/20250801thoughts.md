# The narrative is set and it's bad

There is no help coming for Palestine from the leaders of the American bloc of countries. And by the American bloc I mean their traditional allies like Canada, France, the UK. And the countries the US protects or props up like the Gulf countries, Egypt, and Jordan.

Their coordinated statements at the end of July 2025 demanding that Palestinians, or groups of Palestinians render themselves defenceless proves this. It is a complete inversion of reality to witness nearly two years of genocide and go "The solution is to disarm the people suffering the genocide". The fact that this is the narrative of these leaders mean that there will be no meaningful actions like sanctions and arms embargos on the people carrying out the genocide, the state of Israel.

This doesn't make any difference on the reality on the ground, these countries were already fully supporting Israel in both overt and covert ways. For example Canada continuing to send projectiles to Israel despite claiming not to[^1].

We've forced them to cede rhetorical ground, we need to keep going to force them backwards still so there are actual material ones.
