My debut novel, "Under The Full and Crescent Moon", is a tale of speculative history following the trials of a young woman as she struggles to confront a rising tide of zealotry threatening her home.

I tried to create an ancient world that is as steeped in the Islamic faith as it is in feminism; and write a story that not only has a gripping plot and unforgettable characters, but shows the diversity of what it means to be a Muslim. I can't wait for you to read it and then let me know whether I succeeded or not! :smile:

Coming September 2025 from [Dundurn Press](https://www.dundurn.com/), Inshallah!
