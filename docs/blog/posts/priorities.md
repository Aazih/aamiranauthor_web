# Editing and Social Cards

It's been almost a month since my last blog entry. The main reason for that is that I am deep into editing the novel and I have a very very tight deadline for that.

And I have to get back to it so I think this will be a short entry!

One thing that I'm grateful for is that I enjoy feedback on my work. Talking with my beta readers about the novel has been one of the absolute highlights of the writing process so far. I am so grateful for their encouragement and their positive words really sustained me as I polished the manuscript and then went through the process of finding a publisher... which is a process that involves a **lot** of rejection.

Getting feedback from a professional editor is different. It's great! But, being perfectly honest, there is also pain involved.

Which is a good sign that my editor has done exactly what they were supposed to do. I'm not so egotistical to believe that the draft of the book I worked on solo is so amazing that it could not be improved.  Having a second experienced opinion point out the weaker parts is necessary then, even though leaving words I am proud of having written on the cutting room floor is harsh.

I truly believe the end result is going to be a better book and that's all that matters.

The other thing I've completed is the final feature of the website that I've enabled and that's social cards. It's not visible on the site itself but now when I send links out to people on social media, it should look **much** prettier as all 'modern' platforms try and find preview images. It took a lot of technical experimentation to get working.

Perfection comes from iteration though.  And in that websites and novels aren't any different. I'm doing that with the site. Now it's time to get back to doing it with the novel!

Please keep praying for an end to the violence engulfing our world, and pushing for a Free Palestine, online, offline, everywhere that you can.
