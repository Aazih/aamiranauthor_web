# One week into being a published author

So it's been a week since my book "Under The Full and Crescent Moon" launched and the question becomes, What's next?

<!-- more -->

And the answer honestly is... I don't... know? It was never a goal of mine to be a novelist. I just got a story in my head about a young woman defending a Muslim matriarchy with fatwas that demanded to be a novel. And I've been incredibly lucky and blessed to have been able to do so and get a publisher and get it out into the world and I've learned so much about the publishing industry and met so many amazing people and it's all been a joy. Along with a lot of stress.. don't get me wrong. And there's the US and UK paperback launches to look forward too and the e-book is out worldwide which is amazing. And I'm never to go stop talking about my novel because I am so happy with how it has turned out.

But there's always more you know? There's all these markers of success that I did not know about before, how many reviews do you get, how many events do you get invited to, there's lists, long lists, short lists, awards. And all of those things are important because they get the word out about the novel and means it has more chances of finding readers who will enjoy it, maybe even love it, or learn something valuable from it. And then there's of course... sales. I could definitely use more money.

And I'm human, I want all of those thing for my novel. I'm not going to deny that.

But.

All of these things are out of my control and really, in many ways the work of a book is done when even one person enjoys reading it. And whether, Inshallah, all those other markers of success come or not, that part is done.

Check it out if you're interested and let's also work towards a world where every Palestinian, Congolese, and Sudanese person can set these goals for themselves and strive for them rather than just struggle for survival in the face of horrific oppression.

All opinions my own, in the end only God knows best.
