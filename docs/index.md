<p style="text-align: center;">My debut novel is coming September 2025 from <a href=https://www.dundurn.com>Dundurn Press</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It's the story of a young woman coming of age while defending her city from zealots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A city of the Islamic Golden Age that is Muslim... and a matriarchy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And the weapons she wields are the Sharia and her fatwas.</p>
