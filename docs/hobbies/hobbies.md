Once upon a time I used to read voraciously. As a child I took full advantage of my uncle and aunt's incredibly well stocked library in Karachi where I spent my summers with my cousins. Later, in Mississauga, I wore out a few library cards as I steadily devoured the fantasy and sci-fi sections of the South Common public library. But as my free time shrank as I grew older I had to make some choices, and reading and computer games both were sacrificed in favour of writing and advocacy. (Full disclosure, I did reduce my reading well before I reduced my game time :sweat_smile:)

## Pathfinder (Tabletop RPG)

Around 2014 though I was able to find a hobby that managed to combine my love of games, reading, *and* writing all into one. Table Top Role Playing Games played over message boards. I'd argue these are a niche genre of improvisational speculative fiction unto themselves as players write out their actions and the 'Game Masters' running the game respond with their own prose and both react to the consequences of the roll of virtual dice. It's a genre that invites readers to participate and I did. Enough so that I'm looking to self-publish my own additions for my ttrpg of choice, Pathfinder Second Edition, which is kind of the hipster version of the eponymous Dungeons and Dragons.

I realize I'm dating myself by the use of the word 'hipster', but sometimes dated terms are the most accurate. It is what it is.

I've done enough in the hobby for it to deserve it's [own page.](ttrpg.md)

## Technology

I work in technology and I enjoy it enough that I've worked on a few projects on my own. The one I'm most proud of is lost to time as the University webserver it was hosted on got decommissioned, but it did get me an acknowledgement in my Classics Professor's work on the use of numbers by ancient and modern Greek historians [Quantifying Mentalities](https://press.umich.edu/Books/Q/Quantifying-Mentalities2).

Tech is not a driving factor in my life. I am not a tech-bro... more of a tech-second cousin. I am steeped in it enough though that I have my own [github page!](https://github.com/Aazih) . Too bad the platform wasn't around earlier and I would have been able to preserve my earlier projects. C'est la vie I suppose.
