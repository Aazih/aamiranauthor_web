# Small wins on the way to Liberation

The fight for the liberation of all Palestinians in all of Palestine has seen some major victories lately

<!-- more -->

On the 25th of September 2025 Microsoft announced that it was cutting off some cloud services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense[^1][^2].

On the 21st of September 2025 Canada along with other stalwart allies of Israel, the UK, and Australia announced their recognition of the State of Palestine[^3][^4]

These are real and tangible wins on the road to freeing Palestine from the river to the sea. But let us be clear, they do not go nearly far enough.

Microsoft is still supplying the Israeli government with plenty of services. And the recognition of the state of Palestine puts onerous conditions on Palestinians such as demanding control over Palestinian governance and elections and absurdly demanding that Palestine be demilitarized. Mark Carney is so completely compromised that he has called, not once, but ***twice*** for a 'Zionist' Palestine. Well Carney, we have seen what a demilitarized and 'Zionist' Palestine looks like. It looks like the brutal ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the West Bank and the beyond horrific genocide of Palestinians in Gaza which has ramped up to the level of unimaginable here in the last week of September 2025.

But neither Microsoft, or Canada, or the UK, or Australia wanted to take this step. They have shown over the last two years that their preference is for their workers and citizens to put our heads down and with our cowed and humiliated silence give assent to the genocide. It is only through constant effort and pressure that we have forced these half measures and dashed their hopes. The complicit Western media is keeping the news of all the actions taken to get here suppressed, but they cannot hide the tangible results.

And so the way forward is clear. The goal was never to cut a few cloud services, or mere symbolic diplomatic gestures, the goal has always been full liberation for Palestine and justice for the millions harmed by the genocidal state of Israel. We keep up the pressure.
