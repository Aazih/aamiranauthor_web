My debut novel, "Under The Full and Crescent Moon", is a tale of speculative history following the trials of a young woman as she struggles to confront a rising tide of zealotry threatening her home. I tried to create an ancient world that is as steeped in the Islamic faith as it is in feminism. I can't wait for you to read it and then let me know whether I succeeded or not! :smile:
