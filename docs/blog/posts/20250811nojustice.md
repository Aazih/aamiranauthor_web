# No Justice

The desire for justice is a core part of being human. I believe this fundamentally. It is why we feel it so deeply when we are treated unfairly & why we react so negatively when we see injustice done to another human being.

So to systematically inflict injustice on an entire people, first those people need to be removed from humanity, removed from the category of those who deserve justice.

This is what Zionist Israelis have done to Palestinians. Is the only way for them to carry out their atrocities on a daily basis for more than twenty months, for more than 77 years.

But this is also what we in the Zionist West, have done. Because in our Zionist culture it is unthinkable for Palestinians to desire justice for the crimes committed against them, let alone achieve it. It is just not part of the conversation. It just does not even exist as a concept in Western Mass Media.

## Impunity

This impunity is what has allowed Israeli Zionists to murder more than 230 journalists since the start of their accelerated genocide in Gaza since October 2023, the latest horror being their targeted killing of 5 journalists on the 10th of August 2025, including Anas Al-Sharif.

It is what allows Western Zionists to smear his name with unfounded allegations and not even mention the necessity to bring his murderers to justice.

## Consequence

The growing numbers of the rest of us are not Zionist however and understand what we must be loud for. What we must fight for.

In his posthumous letter he said:

"I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland."

All the resources of the American bloc of countries, including Canada, have been dedicated to silencing us, restraining us, and fending off the justice that the genocidal Zionist state of Israel is due.

But another fundamental belief I have is that justice is inevitable.

Justice demands Anas Al-Sharif's murderers be brought to account. Justice demands nothing less than a Free Palestine from the river to the sea. It is coming.
