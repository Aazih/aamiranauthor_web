# Happy Canada Day

Happy Canada Day everyone. Let's take the opportunity to talk about something our Prime Minister, Mark Carney said on CNN in late June 2025. He said, and I am paraphrasing slightly that we cannot have peace in the Middle East unless we have a 'Zionist, if you will, Palestinian state' that recognizes the right of Israel to 'not live in fear'.

This is so incredibly insane that I am left wondering what Canadian values even are anymore. Let's quickly analyze this.

<!-- more -->

Firstly he's making the Palestinian right to self-determination dependent on them accepting a political ideology. This is ridiculous and paternalistic right at the base of it, but requiring Palestinians to adopt an ideology that, as we speak, is justifying not only using starvation as a weapon of war against them, but weaponizing aid distribution as well is heinous. Zionism has been the driving force for nearly two years of genocide now. What Canadian values are being served by promoting it? Please Mr. Carney let me know what the overlap is between genocide and Canadian values.

Secondly, insisting on the right of Israel to not live in fear is a straight up insidious and evil condition to put on peace. And the reason is, that **every country lies in fear of its neighbours**. This is why they have *militaries*. Canada lives in fear of a US invasion, Finland leaves in fear of a Russian invasion. It's an unavoidable and permanent part of contemporary human society. And Carney's stated worldview directly means that Israel's permanent *fear* justifies Israel's permanent *war*. It's an ugly one sided justification that no other country in the world gets, because well, what about the Palestinians right to 'not live in fear' Mark?

Happy Canada Day. All opinions are my own, in the end only God knows best.
