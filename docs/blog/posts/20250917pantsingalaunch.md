# Plotting the book, Pantsing the Launch

So I'm a plotter, as a writer. Which means for my upcoming novel, "Under The Full And Crescent Moon", I had a very clear  outline of what I wanted the story to be.

<!-- more -->

I had the first scene, the final scene, as well as most of the important scenes in the middle worked out. I had a timeline, extensive notes on how the political, economic, and legal systems worked out for the imagined Muslim matriarchy that is the setting. And I put all of it in. Don't worry my editors cut like 80% of it out.

So plotting is how I like to create.

All that to say I wanted to make this video 8 days ago, two weeks out from the Canadian launch of the book. And here I am making it 6 days from the launch. Because there is *no way* to **plot** the launch of a novel.

It's pantsing all the way. And pantsing is when you have no plan, but you're writing anyway.

Life is pantsing, not plotting. I'm trying to be less stressed about the launch and just enjoy the ride. I'd love if you could help me out by preordering, following, etc.

Free Palestine from the River to the Sea. Resisting a genocide is good. So don't just support it. Join it.
