# The final boss of Zionist rhetoric

So one thing we need to talk about is Zohran Mamdani recently saying he will now discourage the use of the phrase "Globalize the Intifada." on the 8th of September on MSNBC.[^1]

<!-- more -->

This led to Mohammad El-Kurd, renowned Palestinian writer and poet publicly calling Mamdani out on twitter a day later.[^2]

Now some slack can be given to Mamdani as he exists in a political reality where, to be elected, he has to keep Liberal Zionists like Brad Landers and Bernie Sanders on side and in a media environment where he has to show he will be a mayor even for New Yorkers terrified of any mention of Palestinian resistance.

And that's the problem. That the vilification of any and all forms of Palestinian resistance has still persisted and Mamdani can't just dismiss Jewish ethno-supremacism as he can white ethno-supremacism. This is the final defense of Zionist rhetoric. The final boss. That even though the vast majority of citizens living under the influence of the American superpower now agree that Israel is a villain, they still fall for the argument that resistance to Israel's horrific depravity is somehow just as bad, if not worse.  And so even as Israel escalates its violations of international law and the horrors of its livestreamed genocide and manmade famine deepen, it still remains a 'complicated' issue. There is an excellent article by Ryan Grim of Dropsite News on the 5th of September 2025 that goes into leaked polling from Israel itself that shows this. Israel is hated but the hatred lessens when they are compared to the Palestinian resistance group Hamas and their ally, the country of Iran.[^3]

And that's a failure of a lot of Pro-Palestinian rhetoric. Which brings me to the criticism by the Palestinian poet Refaat Al-Areer, martyred by a cowardly Israeli air-strike, of journalist and news personality Mehdi Hasan[^4]. A part of which is that Hasan employs the strategy of tying Hamas to Israeli funding which... while does a very good job of showing Israeli hypocrisy and nefariousness... also delegitimizes the Palestinian resistance as a tool of Israel as any and all Palestinian resistance has been tied to Hamas because of Zionist propaganda and then Mehdi smears them.

There's a lot less room for slack for Hasan as compared to Mamdani, because Hasan's role as a media personality is, not to worry about being elected, but to move the boundaries of legitimate conversation to a place where all Zionist rhetoric can be debunked. His strategy has hit the ceiling that Palestinian thinkers have always said was there, the justification of oppression through the vilification of the resistance.

Thus it's the responsibility of anyone who has taken on the mantle of speaking for the Palestinian cause to, first elevate Palestinian voices like Alareer and El-Kurd, not Mamdani and Hasan who are South Asian in origin, and second *not only* insist that Palestinians should be free from the river to the sea, but also that Palestinians are no exception to the rule that resistance to occupation and oppression is praiseworthy. And so the final absurd moral argument of Zionism, of a Palestinian exception to the heroism of resisting genocide and apartheid falls and there are no more 'complications' left. Armed Palestinian resistance, is not only not the problem, it is a part of the solution to the actual problem, which is the occupation and oppression of Palestinians perpetrated by the Zionist state of Israel.

@ZohranKMamdani
 I have told you this on the phone, in person, and I will reiterate it publicly: what you think of the phrase “globalize the intifada”—our beautiful uprising against occupation—is irrelevant, what matters is that it’s a slogan adopted by a movement that is partly responsible for your success and you mustn’t throw them under the bus. We are facing unprecedented levels of state-repression and institutional censorship, both our political organizing and speech are criminalized, and we are confronting genocide for God’s sake. That you choose to continue elevating Jewish feelings over the lives of Palestinians, over the fact of genocide, is nothing more than punching down on those who have helped elevate you, and not to mention, it is a bad electoral strategy considering you are quite literally winning and need not to bow down to Zionist pressure. The tens of thousands of volunteers who have canvassed for you in the scorching hot sun, they are not to be taken for granted. Their support isn’t unconditional. Remember that.

@mehdirhasan
 is not a friend of Palestine or the voice of the voiceless.
 Mehdi Hasan justifies for clout and cash the extermination of Palestinians and the destruction of Gaza.
 Mehdi Hasan is a cheap sell-out.
